## About MangosR2

MangosR2 is a free, open source MMORPG Framework based mostly on C++.
open source, and is community supported. It is derived from MaNGOS, 
the Massive Network Game Object Server. 
Official support forum - http://mangosr2.2x2forum.com

MangosR2 is free software. You can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

(at your option) any later version.

MangosR2 is not a separate project. This is a fork of the "MaNGOS project" and 
"ScriptDev2 project" intended to test the new code, which for some reason was 
not accepted (or will never be accepted) to those projects.
R2 tries to take the best from MaNGOS, TrinityCore and other projects, while 
trying to preserve consistency and simplicity of MaNGOS code.
